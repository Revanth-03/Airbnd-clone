### Responsive Navbar

The navigation bar includes a profile menu and a search bar. It is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size. The profile menu provides options for signing up, logging in, and accessing various features.

### Sticky Header

The header remains fixed at the top of the page when scrolling, ensuring that the search bar and navigation options are always accessible. This improves the user experience by providing easy access to navigation and search functionality.

### Card Components

The Cards component displays a list of rental properties in a card format. Each card shows images, titles, ratings, descriptions, and prices of the properties. The cards are designed to be responsive and adjust their layout based on the screen size.

### Dynamic Filtering

The Filter component allows users to filter rental listings based on different criteria. It provides an interactive way to narrow down the search results by clicking on different filter options. The selected filter is highlighted, and the corresponding listings are displayed.

### Mobile-Friendly Navigation

The bottom navigation bar and mobile search bar provide a user-friendly navigation experience on mobile devices. The bottom navigation bar includes icons for recent searches, favorites, and nearby locations. The mobile search bar ensures that search functionality is easily accessible on smaller screens.
